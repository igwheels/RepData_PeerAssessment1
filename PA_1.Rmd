## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r loading and preprocessing}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

setwd("~/R for DS/RR_Wk2/")

# Read in data
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# Explore data summary
summary(df)
head(df, 10)

# Filter out days with no steps reported as erroneous
df <- df %>%
        filter(!(is.na(steps)), steps > 0)


```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
